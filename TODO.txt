Not done yet:
-For terrain-hugging bridges, only bring up blocks to level gradient, don't bring down.
-Perhaps check for long nearly-level sections and level them?
-Perhaps also check to see if at any points there are sections that go down then immediately up again, or do so within a small distance?
-Same for up then down, except here perhaps lower rather than raise
-Run loop(s) checking for these multiple times
-Make terrain-hugging bridges be separate feature? or perhaps store that type choice by setting height to -1
-Make separate function for handling loading config options, to reduce code duplication and copying errors
-Make random blocks sometimes be missing? (but only if it can be done efficiently)
-For random holes, see if can make then random for the whole bridge (and make an array first of where to put them, to speed things up!), rather than per-block
-Only have some chance of making a bridge hole-filled
-Make liquid towers be exclusively repulsive
-Look into generating my own towns?
-Multiple material stars?
-Some with streaks? (by having some chance that material will change at any given point in the loop
-Very rarely, just make a gigantic sperical star?
-Increase length of rail lines?
-Increase maximum star radius?
-Rail lines that curve?
-Hmm, tunnels that start from structures in villages?
-Hollow stars with spawners?
-The various things with TODO comments
